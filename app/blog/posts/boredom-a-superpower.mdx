Have you considered what happened to habits? People(including me) can't even go to the washroom without our phone. Every goddamn company is here improving user experience and user interface of everything and using psychology tricks so that we stay addicted.

Okay okay , but why do **nothing**? I think you can guess by now , we are like rats on drugs , addicted to being entertained and we can't stand a second of getting bored but being bored is something very important in this loud world where everyone is fighting for your attention.

Instead of eating cheese after cheese of dopamine like a rat. Just stopping and thinking is a crazy hack to getting to know yourself better. It improves your focus as you don't need constant dopamine hits and can actually help you in life satisfaction. **Sacrificing**, **embracing boredom** and a **solid purpose(A why of life)** are crazy tri-weapon combo boredom leads you. People like Newton have used them to find and explain ground pulling things like gravity.

> Boredom is like a grenade , An ace in the hole which blows up the noise and silences your thoughts instead of ears to think and reconsider the strategy about what to do next , should you fallback , rush towards the base A(plan A) or any other base.

Just don't take the phone for once and try to sit with you and your thoughts , maybe if possible write them down. Do this for a month and you will experience the force of nature inside you. Your desires , passion , thoughts jumbled up in a new chaos which you like. The chaos where you are the main character. You have a purpose , a GOAL to complete. Many obstacles will come your way , but use your Superpower and the tri-weapon combo to reach the end-goal. I call this the game of "GREATNESS" . Whether you win or not , you will have lots of fun and satisfaction.
