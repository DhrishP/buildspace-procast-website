Why do we follow gods in religion , is it because they created universe? is it because they are omnipotent? the answer is* **Idealism**. Is there **r**ise in atheism? Yes but do you really think people have stopped looking for things that give them hope , no the 21st century hope producers are none other than our iconic **SUPERHERO'S**?

Some GODS are completely ideal and some have parts of them which are idealistic , but they have one thing in common that is they emit alot of hope into world and people. Some give it through reliability , some through delusion i.e false hope ,etc. The goal is the same , to HELP PEOPLE and to know someone is there for everybody.

Superheroes are similar in that way except they are **FLAWED** and hence more **ACCESSIBLE.** Superheroes are also idealistic in nature(some parts of them) and promote that we should be morally right but with reasons which are more reasonable than just some stories which are too idealistic in nature. They are more relatable and more modern. No religious GOD will have a pop-culturish love story nor will they show the common struggles a person goes but superheroes like spiderman demonstrates it well. TBH they are **great idols**. People now like flawed things more than ever hence ***depression , failing in stuff is normalized in internet*** ( maybe we shouldn't have went that far) but flawed things are very relatable because **nothing is ever perfect** but superheroes are idealistic in their own way.

Batman does not kill bad guys not because it is not the right thing but he also fears that he will become the same person he sworn to stop. Superman does not do evil stuff because he was loved since his childhood even though he was adopted and was an alien. Hence , always trying to see the goodness in people from childhood and that is what fuels him. Their idealistic part exists in things which people aspire nowadays like the **willpower** of batman or the **kindness** of superman.

Furthermore, superheroes offer a contemporary spin on age-old themes of heroism, sacrifice, and redemption. Through their stories, they provide not only entertainment but also moral and philosophical reflections on the human condition. Their narratives serve as modern-day myths, imparting impactful lessons but they provide the most important thing which makes people strive and hope for more i.e "**OPTIMISM**."

That is more than enough for people nowadays. They serve the purpose of mild hope with more relatability and authenticity. The religious GODS were more effective back in time as people needed a roadmap for their life as some were fighting wars from childhood or some were slaves to some kings. The philosophy of true idealism and one entity works perfectly there. In the end, we crave monogamy in life. SUPERHEROS AND GODS both control the chaos in people's life by providing their own perspective of doing good to the world and both have their drawbacks and benefits. In the end , **"what are people but the story they tell themselves"** so make sure it is great one whether it is from the narrative of **GOD** or **SUPERHEROES** !!
