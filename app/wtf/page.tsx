Those moments when you suddenly understand why you've been avoiding a task, or when seemingly unrelated pieces of information come together in a meaningful way. It's similar to what Steve Jobs referred to as "connecting the dots."
The same thing can happen when you're exploring philosophy or psychology. You might be reading through someone's ideas from the past, and unexpectedly, your perspective changes. So many cool connections were missed due to no quick access to jote them down so made stream which is like miniblog for my CTD's.(Connecting the Dots) moments`}
